# AI Travel Planner - Performance Monitoring

## Overview

Performance monitoring ensures the application runs efficiently and reliably in production. This document outlines the tools and strategies used to monitor, analyze, and optimize performance.

## Monitoring Tools

- **Vercel Analytics**: Real-time performance and traffic monitoring
- **LogRocket**: Frontend performance and error tracking
- **Sentry**: Error and exception monitoring for both frontend and backend
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: (Optional) For custom metrics and dashboards

## Key Metrics

- Response time (API and page loads)
- Error rates (client and server)
- Uptime and availability
- Database query performance
- Resource usage (CPU, memory)
- User engagement and retention

## Alerting

- Set up alerts for high error rates, slow response times, and downtime
- Use Vercel, Sentry, or custom webhooks for notifications (Slack, email, etc.)

## Logging

- Centralized logging for all services
- Use Vercel logs, Sentry, or a custom solution
- Log important events, errors, and performance bottlenecks

## Performance Optimization Strategies

- Server-side rendering and static site generation
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Monitoring third-party API latency

## Regular Review

- Review performance dashboards weekly
- Address bottlenecks and regressions promptly
- Continuously improve based on monitoring insights
